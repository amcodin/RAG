# Project Brief: Internet Plan Price Retrieval Application

## Overview

Develop a Python application utilizing AutoGen v0.4 to create a multi-agent system that retrieves and verifies prices for internet plans. The system will process user inputs—including a URL, desired download speed, and an optional plan name—to coordinate a team of agents. These agents will collaboratively extract pricing information from the provided URL, validate its accuracy, and return the verified price to the user.

## Objectives

- **Input Handling**: Accept user inputs specifying a URL, download speed, and an optional plan name.
- **Agent Team Formation**: Implement a team of agents using AutoGen's multi-agent framework to handle the price retrieval and verification process.
- **Price Retrieval**: Extract pricing information from the specified URL based on the provided download speed and plan name.
- **Price Verification**: Ensure the retrieved price is accurate and up-to-date.
- **Response Delivery**: Return the verified price to the user in a structured format.

## Features

- **AutoGen Integration**: Leverage AutoGen v0.4's capabilities to manage agent interactions and workflows. [AutoGen Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/autogenstudio-user-guide/index.html)
- **Round-Robin Agent Coordination**: Utilize a round-robin scheduling mechanism to distribute tasks evenly among agents, ensuring efficient collaboration.
- **Price Verification Mechanism**: Implement a verification step to assess the reliability of the retrieved pricing information, enhancing the system's accuracy.
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor and report the computational costs associated with each agent's operations, providing transparency and aiding in performance optimization.

## Technical Approach

1. **AutoGen Setup**: Install and configure AutoGen v0.4 in the development environment. [AutoGen Installation Guide](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/autogenstudio-user-guide/index.html)
2. **Agent Development**:
   - **Agent Creation**: Define agents responsible for specific tasks within the price retrieval and verification process.
   - **Team Formation**: Organize agents into a team with a round-robin task distribution system to ensure balanced workload management.
3. **Price Retrieval Implementation**:
   - **Web Scraping**: Develop agents capable of extracting pricing information from the provided URL, considering the download speed and plan name parameters.
   - **Data Parsing**: Implement robust parsing mechanisms to accurately interpret pricing data from diverse web formats.
4. **Price Verification**:
   - **Data Cross-Referencing**: Enable agents to cross-check retrieved prices with authoritative sources to confirm accuracy.
   - **Reliability Assessment**: Incorporate mechanisms to evaluate the trustworthiness of pricing information, utilizing frameworks like AgentEval.
5. **Cost Tracking**:
   - **Computational Cost Monitoring**: Implement tracking of computational resources used by each agent, aiding in performance analysis and optimization.
6. **Response Handling**:
   - **Structured Output**: Design agents to return the verified price in a standardized format, facilitating easy integration with other systems or user interfaces.

## Documentation and Resources

- **AutoGen Documentation**: Refer to the official AutoGen documentation for detailed guidance on agent creation, team management, and cost tracking. [AutoGen Documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/user-guide/autogenstudio-user-guide/index.html)
- **AgentEval Framework**: Utilize the AgentEval framework to assess and enhance the effectiveness of the agent team in retrieving and verifying prices.
- **Cost Tracking with AutoGen**: Implement cost tracking mechanisms as outlined in AutoGen's usage guidelines to monitor computational expenses.

## Considerations

- **Scalability**: Design the system to handle varying loads by efficiently scaling the number of agents and distributing tasks.
- **Reliability**: Ensure agents can handle exceptions and errors gracefully, maintaining system stability during price retrieval and verification processes.
- **Performance**: Optimize agents for speed and accuracy, minimizing latency in retrieving and verifying pricing information.
- **Security**: Implement necessary security measures to protect user data and ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: Set up the development environment, install AutoGen v0.4, and design the agent architecture.
- **Week 3-4**: Develop individual agents and integrate them into a cohesive team with round-robin task distribution.
- **Week 5-6**: Implement price retrieval and verification functionalities, incorporating cost tracking mechanisms.
- **Week 7**: Conduct thorough testing, including performance, reliability, and security assessments.
- **Week 8**: Finalize documentation and prepare the application for deployment.

## Conclusion

This project aims to create a robust Python application that leverages AutoGen v0.4's multi-agent capabilities to efficiently retrieve and verify internet plan prices. By integrating advanced agent coordination, price verification, and cost tracking, the application will provide users with accurate and reliable pricing information tailored to their specified requirements.
