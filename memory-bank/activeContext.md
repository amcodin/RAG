# Active Context

## Current Focus
Initial project setup and foundational documentation establishment.

## Recent Changes
- Created project brief defining core requirements and objectives
- Established product context and user experience goals
- Documented system patterns and architecture
- Defined technical context and development requirements
- Added AutoGen extensions (MultimodalWebSurfer and Magentic-one)
- Enhanced agent architecture with advanced web interaction capabilities

## Active Decisions
1. **Model Integration**
   - Implemented Gemini-2.0-Flash integration in coordinator
   - Configured model parameters for optimal extraction
   - Added cost and performance tracking

2. **Agent Coordination Strategy**
   - Implemented MagenticOneCoordinator with Gemini model
   - Built round-robin fallback system
   - Added comprehensive metrics tracking

3. **Web Content Processing**
   - Implemented MultimodalWebSurfer for primary processing
   - Added BeautifulSoup4 fallback for basic scraping
   - Implemented confidence scoring system

4. **Agent Architecture**
   - Implemented three-tier system:
     1. MagenticCoordinator (primary)
     2. WebSurferAgent (content processing)
     3. RoundRobinDistributor (fallback)
   - Added performance monitoring for each component
   - Implemented error handling and recovery

## Current Considerations

### High Priority
1. Complete response parsing in coordinator
2. Implement price and speed extraction in web surfer
3. Test parallel processing in fallback system
4. Add caching mechanism

### Technical Decisions Made
1. Using BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing
2. Implemented confidence scoring system
3. Added comprehensive error handling
4. Built metrics tracking for all components

### Open Questions
1. Cache invalidation strategy
2. Rate limiting implementation
3. Cost optimization techniques
4. Testing strategy for different website formats

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement TODO items in extraction methods
2. Add unit tests for core functionality
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Add request caching

### Short-term Goals
1. Complete testing framework
2. Add performance benchmarks
3. Implement cache layer
4. Document API usage

### Documentation Needs
1. API documentation
2. Agent interaction patterns
3. Error handling procedures
4. Deployment guide
